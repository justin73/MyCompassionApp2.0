                	<h3>What is compassion?</h3>
                    <p>Compassion is an emotional response when you see suffering and desire to help alleviate that suffering. Compassion is something we all feel but too often, most of us don't act on our desire to end the suffering we see.</p>

                	<h3>Being compassionate is like dancing...</h3>
                    <p>The more you practice, the better you get. This app helps you put more compassion in your life by spending a few moments each day thinking and meditating on it.</p>

                    <p>My Compassion App sends you a daily quote, at a time you choose, about compassion and its positive effects on you and those around you.
                    <br/><br/>The app helps you practice compassion by creating a few minutes of timed, silent meditation on compassion in your life?you decide how long.
                    <br/><br/>And you can keep track of your thoughts and experiences practicing compassion with the app's daily diary.</p>

                	<h3>I'm new to meditating? How do I do it?</h3>
                    <p>Here are a couple of suggestions:
                    
                    <br/><br/><em>1.</em>&nbsp;<strong>How to meditate?</strong><br/>You can walk or sit to meditate.
                    <br/><br/><em>2.</em>&nbsp;<strong>Start small?</strong><br/>Commit to just 2 minutes a day. You can do it for 5 minutes or 10 if you feel good about it, but commit to something you can stick with.
                    <br/><br/><em>3.</em>&nbsp;<strong>Pick a trigger?</strong><br/>You can use the app's timed, daily quote as a trigger or something like brushing your teeth or washing the dishes at supper to remind you to meditate.
                    <br/><br/><em>4.</em>&nbsp;<strong>Find a quiet spot?</strong><br/>If you sit, sit comfortably on a pillow or a chair. If you walk, walk on a smooth, level surface, indoors or out. This isn't hiking or aerobics; your focus should be on more compassion in your life, not staying upright.
                    <br/><br/><em>5.</em>&nbsp;<strong>Set the timer and focus on your breath</strong> - follow it in through your nostrils, your throat, your chest and belly. Sit or walk straight, keep your eyes open but looking at the ground in front of you with a soft focus. Now think about your day ahead and how compassion can be part of it.</p>

                	<h3>That sounds pretty easy? Is that all there is to it?</h3>
                    <p>Yup, it's that simple. Try meditating on compassion in your life for at least 2 minutes following the same trigger every day. Do this for a month and you'll have a daily compassion meditation habit; we think you'll also be a lot more self-aware and already practicing more compassion with the people around you.

                	<h3>Compassion meditation can be challenging.</h3>
                    <p>Unlike other meditations such as loving kindness or appreciative joy, you don't start with yourself or with positive things in your life. Compassion looks at suffering and how to resolve it. It often means we have to think about difficult people or consider difficult actions we normally avoid.<br/><br/> True compassion has to be sincere – you can't "fake it till you make it". For beginner practitioners it is recommended to focus on those for whom you feel easy, genuine compassion. As experience grows, expand your compassion more broadly until it is spontaneous and limitless. <br/><br/> 
					<em>1.</em>&nbsp;Select a comfortable posture in a quiet and peaceful place to meditate.<br/>Give yourself a few moments to become aware of your mind and body, relaxing muscle and mental tension. <br/><br/> 
					<em>2.</em>&nbsp;Turn your mind toward a person who has experienced a misfortune for whom you feel an easy, instinctive empathy and desire to relieve suffering.<br/>Focus on somebody who has had a difficult day, an accident or illness, who has lost a loved one - they all can be the subject of true compassion. Sincerity is critical so choose somebody close and sympathetic; it's hard to show genuine compassionate for strangers or for people for whom we don't feel any empathy.<br/><br/> 
					<em>3.</em>&nbsp;Wish the focus of your meditation freedom from their sorrow or stress and recovery to a happier present.<br/>If your attempt to feel compassion turns to feelings of guilt or resentment or self-criticism, observe these feelings as objectively as you can. You haven't failed in showing sincere compassion – you've only met some of the obstacles in your mind that you need to overcome. <br/><br/> 
					<em>4.</em>&nbsp;Practice gentle mindfulness and awareness of just compassion.<br/>Continue directing compassion to situations you are aware of, moving from those close to you to those further away. The goal is give each person or situation the meditation time needed to let the heart and mind become peaceful and to develop equanimity towards the subject of compassion.<br/>Expand your compassion as you become steadier in ability to regard suffering and imagine its resolution. With care, you may start to direct your attention and attempt to feel sincere compassion towards someone who has done harmful things.<br/><br/>
					<em>5.</em>&nbsp;Recognize and let go of barriers that occur in your mind.<br/>Sorrow, frustration, desire, resentment, anger, disgust, and coldness can all be barriers to developing peace, forgiveness and understanding and they can all be overcome. This is one of the greatest benefits of practicing compassion meditation.<br/><br/>
					<em>6.</em>&nbsp;Be aware how true compassion can become false and harmful compassion.<br/>The traps are numerous: sorrow and despair because of our own powerlessness to relieve more suffering; despair that we cannot "change the world"; ego trips based on a conviction that we should be recognized as humanitarians or saintly people; a sense of moral or ethical superiority over those who are the subjects of our meditation; anger that makes us turn away as opposed to anger that moves us to action.<br/><br/>
					<em>7.</em>&nbsp;Consider ways that you can be more compassionate in your day to day life.</p>
